    <center><h1>Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra </h1></center>
    Samsung has kept the design of its Ultra variant relatively similar since the Galaxy S22 Ultra in 2022, with minor refinements. However, according to leaked images of the Galaxy S26 series' dummy units by tipster OnLeaks, this may be about to change.

The images showcase a new unified camera module on the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra. The S26 Ultra in particular gets a triple camera module, along with two separate cutouts that accommodate its entire camera setup. The camera module does look quite similar to what we have seen on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy TriFold. The reason for the larger camera bump appears to be a thinner chassis for the device.

While this design does bring something fresh to the Galaxy S series, it may also cause the phone to wobble when kept on a flat surface.
